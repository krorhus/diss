The files here are used to replicate the analysis done in the main R script 'rorhus_dissertation_code.R'. These should be downloaded together into one folder. 

The folder 'sps' contains the GIS vectorisations of each of the original 3,248 geometric microliths. It is quite large, and not necessary for the running of the script (only the 'oriented_outlines' folder is needed); instead, they are provided in case testing certain functions, such as the Reliab code, is desired. 

The 'GIS data' folder contains the GIS representations necessary for creating the ideal dataset.

The pairwise MANOVA results and the standard deviations of the ideal representations are in 
the file 'PW_and_SD_tables.xlsx'. Note that they are in different sheets in the workbook.
